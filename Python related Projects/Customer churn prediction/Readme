# Customer Churn Prediction (CDAC Final Project)

This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn â€” identifying customers likely to leave the service. The goal is to build interpretable and high-performance machine learning models aligned with the CDAC PG-DBDA syllabus.

---

## Dataset

- File: `Cdac_Customer_Churn.csv`
- Rows: ~99,800
- Target Column: `Churn` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Source: Simulated Telco dataset

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
- Dropped rows with missing values
- Checked column-wise unique values

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Encoded binary columns (`Yes`/`No`, `Male`/`Female`)
- One-hot encoded multi-category columns (e.g., `Contract`, `InternetService`)
- Scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler`

### 3. Model Training
The following models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC AUC Score
- Log Loss

## Business Insights

- Churn is highest among customers on **month-to-month contracts** with **fiber optic internet** and **no tech support**
- Adding tech support and moving customers to longer contracts could improve retention

---

## Libraries Used

- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

---

## How to Run

```bash
# 1. Install requirements
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn

# 2. Run the notebook (Colab/Jupyter)
````

## Future Enhancements

* Streamlit app for real-time churn prediction
* Model performance comparison charts
* Customer segmentation using KMeans clustering
